# Express Note Taker

## Description

Your task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an [SVG file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.
